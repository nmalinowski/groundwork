# Product Design Skill

Interactive workflow for iteratively designing and documenting product requirements in EARS format.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Understand** - Clarify the feature/change request through targeted questions
2. **Design** - Draft EARS requirements and check for contradictions
3. **Approve** - Present draft for user approval
4. **Commit** - Edit the PRD document when requirements are approved
5. **Next Step** - Ask user what to do next (architecture, UX, or another feature)

## Step 0: Do we have context?

If the user called the skill without any context, ask them to provide context on what feature they want to add, modify or remove.

## Step 0.5: Load Project Context

Before clarifying the request, load existing specs so you can detect contradictions and understand constraints:

**Check for and read (if they exist):**
- `specs/architecture.md` (or `specs/architecture/` directory) — technology choices, component boundaries, decision records. Use to catch architecturally infeasible requirements early.
- `specs/design_system.md` — design principles, brand decisions, UX patterns. Use to ensure new features align with established design language.
- `specs/product_specs.md` (or `specs/product_specs/` directory) — already loaded implicitly by the contradiction check, but read it explicitly here for full cross-feature context.

For each, check single file first, then directory. If a directory, aggregate all `.md` files.

If none exist, that's fine — proceed without them.

## Step 1: Understand the Request

Invoke the `groundwork:understanding-feature-requests` skill to clarify the feature and check for contradictions.

If architecture and design system were loaded in Step 0.5, provide them as context so the clarification can also check for:
- **Architectural feasibility** — requirements that conflict with technology choices or component boundaries
- **Design consistency** — features that would require patterns contradicting the established design system

This skill will:
1. Ask clarifying questions (core, exploratory, conditional)
2. Check for internal, cross-feature, and technical contradictions
3. Resolve any conflicts before proceeding

Once understanding is complete and conflicts resolved, continue to Step 2.

## Step 2: Design EARS Requirements

Once the feature is understood, draft requirements using EARS syntax.

### EARS Syntax Reference

| Pattern | Template | Use When |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Event-Driven** | When `<trigger>` then the system shall `<response>` | Behavior triggered by events |
| **State-Driven** | While `<state>` the system shall `<behavior>` | Continuous behavior during state |
| **Unwanted** | If `<condition>` then the system shall `<mitigation>` | Handling errors/edge cases |
| **Optional** | Where `<feature enabled>` the system shall `<behavior>` | Configurable features |
| **Complex** | While `<state>`, when `<trigger>`, the system shall `<response>` | Compound conditions |

### Requirement Quality Checklist

Each requirement must be:
- [ ] **Atomic** - One behavior per requirement
- [ ] **Testable** - Clear pass/fail criteria exist
- [ ] **Technology-agnostic** - No implementation details
- [ ] **Unambiguous** - Single interpretation possible
- [ ] **Traceable** - Has unique ID following project convention

### ID Convention

Follow the existing PRD convention: `PRD-<FEATURE>-REQ-<NNN>`

Examples from the project:
- `PRD-FINE-REQ-001` (Finetuning feature)
- `PRD-GEN-REQ-001` (Generation feature)
- `PRD-IMP-REQ-001` (Impersonation detection)
- `PRD-MON-REQ-001` (Monetization)
- `PRD-DEL-REQ-001` (Data deletion)

For new features, propose a short code (3-4 chars) and confirm with user.

### Check for Contradictions

Before presenting the draft, review for conflicts:

#### Cross-Feature Conflicts
Compare new requirements against existing PRD:
- **Behavioral conflicts:** New behavior contradicts existing behavior
- **Resource competition:** Features that compete for same limited resources
- **UX inconsistency:** Different patterns for similar interactions
- **Data conflicts:** Contradictory data ownership or access rules

Example: New "anonymous posting" requirement conflicts with existing "all user actions must be audited"

#### Technical Incompatibilities
Requirements that may be technically difficult to satisfy together:
- Performance constraints that conflict
- Security requirements that limit functionality
- Scalability needs that conflict with simplicity

**If conflicts found, surface them:**
> "I noticed a potential conflict:
> - [Existing requirement or pattern] requires [X]
> - This new requirement requires [Y]
> These may be incompatible because [reason].
>
> Options:
> 1. Modify the new requirement to [alternative]
> 2. Update the existing requirement
> 3. Accept the conflict as a known trade-off
>
> How should we resolve this?"

**After resolution:**
- If user chooses option 1 (modify new): Update the draft requirement and re-present
- If user chooses option 2 (update existing): Note the PRD change needed and proceed
- If user chooses option 3 (accept trade-off): Document the trade-off in the feature block and proceed

Do not proceed to Step 3 until conflicts are resolved or explicitly accepted.

### Present Progressively

When presenting complex feature blocks:
- Break into 200-300 word segments
- Seek confirmation after each section before continuing
- Start with problem/outcome, then scope, then requirements
- This catches misunderstandings early and keeps stakeholders engaged

## Step 3: Present Draft for Approval

Before editing the PRD, present the complete feature block:

```markdown
### [Feature Number] Feature Name

**Problem / outcome**
[1-2 sentences describing the problem and desired outcome]

**In scope**
- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]

**Out of scope**
- [Explicit exclusion 1]

**EARS Requirements**
- `PRD-XXX-REQ-001` When [trigger] then the system shall [response].
- `PRD-XXX-REQ-002` When [trigger] then the system shall [response].

**Acceptance criteria**
- [Testable criterion 1]
- [Testable criterion 2]

**Telemetry** (optional)
- [Metric to track]

**Rollout** (optional)
- Phase 1: [description]
- Phase 2: [description]
```

Ask: "Does this capture your requirements? Any changes before I update the PRD?"

**Scope discipline:**
- Apply YAGNI thinking - challenge every "nice to have"
- Ask: "What's the simplest version that delivers the core value?"
- If scope feels large, propose a phased approach

## Step 4: Commit to PRD

**PRD Location:** The PRD may be stored as:
- Single file: `specs/product_specs.md`
- Directory: `specs/product_specs/` (with content split across files)

When the user approves:

1. **Check if PRD exists** - Look for single file first, then directory
   - If missing, create `specs/product_specs.md` using the template in `references/prd-template.md`
   - Ensure `specs/` directory exists first

2. **Route the content** - Determine where to write based on spec format:
   - **Single file mode:** Edit `specs/product_specs.md` directly
   - **Directory mode:** Route to appropriate file:
     - Features with ID (e.g., PRD-AUTH-*) → `specs/product_specs/03-features/<feature-code>.md`
     - Open questions → `specs/product_specs/05-open-questions.md`
     - If unsure, append to `specs/product_specs/_index.md`

3. **Find insertion point** - New features go in Section 3 (Feature list) after existing features
4. **Edit the document** - Use `str_replace` to insert the new feature block
5. **Update open questions** - If any remain, add to Section 5 (Open questions log)
6. **Update traceability note** - Mention new requirement IDs if relevant

After editing, confirm: "I've added [feature] to the PRD with requirements PRD-XXX-REQ-001 through PRD-XXX-REQ-NNN."

## Step 5: Ask What's Next

After successfully updating the PRD, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to present the next step options:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What would you like to do next?",
    "header": "Next step",
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "Design architecture",
        "description": "Translate these requirements into technical architecture decisions"
      },
      {
        "label": "Design UX",
        "description": "Create user experience designs and flows for this feature"
      },
      {
        "label": "Create tasks",
        "description": "Generate implementation tasks for this feature"
      },
      {
        "label": "Add another feature",
        "description": "Continue adding more features to the PRD"
      }
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

**Handle the response:**

- **Design architecture**: Invoke the `groundwork:architecture` skill to design the technical approach
- **Design UX**: Invoke the `groundwork:ux-design` skill to create UX designs
- **Create tasks**: Invoke the `groundwork:tasks` skill to generate implementation tasks for the new feature
- **Add another feature**: Clear context by summarizing what was just added, then restart from Step 1 with a fresh feature request. Ask: "What feature would you like to add next?"

## Conversation Patterns

### Adding a New Feature
```
User: I want to add a feature for artists to share their portfolios publicly.

Claude: Great idea! Let me understand this better:
1. What should be shareable - just the generated outputs, or training images too?
2. Should other users be able to interact (like/comment) or just view?
3. Are there privacy controls the artist should have?

[User answers...]

Claude: Based on your answers, here's what I'm proposing:

### 3.X Portfolio Sharing

**Problem / outcome**
Artists want to showcase their AI-generated work publicly to attract commissions.

**In scope**
- Public gallery page per artist
- ...

**EARS Requirements**
- `PRD-PORT-REQ-001` When an artist enables public portfolio then the system shall...

Does this capture it? Any changes?
```

### Modifying an Existing Requirement
```
User: PRD-IMP-REQ-008 should lock the account after 5 attempts, not N.

Claude: I'll update PRD-IMP-REQ-008 to specify 5 attempts:

**Before:** When impersonation attempts exceed N per day...
**After:** When impersonation attempts exceed 5 per day...

Should I also add a configuration option for admins to adjust this threshold, or keep it fixed at 5?
```

### Clarifying Ambiguity
```
User: Add a requirement for faster generation.

Claude: "Faster" needs to be specific for a testable requirement. Currently PRD specifies p95 < 2s.
- What latency target do you have in mind? (e.g., p95 < 1s, p99 < 2s)
- Does this apply to all generation types or specific ones?
- Are there trade-offs you'd accept (e.g., lower quality for speed)?
```
