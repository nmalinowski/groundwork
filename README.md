# Groundwork

A comprehensive skills and workflow library for Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI, consolidating proven techniques for planning, design, TDD, debugging, collaboration, and problem-solving.

## Installation

### GitHub Copilot CLI (Plugin)

Groundwork now ships a Copilot-compatible plugin manifest at `plugin.json` with generated assets under `copilot/`.

Install from a local checkout:

```bash
copilot plugin install .
```

Or install from GitHub:

```bash
copilot plugin install https://github.com/etr/groundwork
```

To regenerate Copilot assets after editing source agents/skills/commands/hooks:

```bash
node tools/generate-copilot-assets.js
```

### Via Marketplace

First, add the Groundwork marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/etr/groundwork-marketplace
```

Then install the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin install groundwork
```

### Direct Installation

```bash
claude plugin install https://github.com/etr/groundwork
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins
git clone https://github.com/etr/groundwork.git
```

### Verify Installation

Restart Claude Code or start a new session. You should see:
- Start typing `/groundwork`. It should show groundwork commands available

Run `/groundwork-check` to validate the plugin installation.

## Dependencies

- **Required**: `node`, `python3`
- **Optional**: `gh` (GitHub CLI for PR commands)

### Windows Users

Groundwork requires a Unix-like shell environment. Windows users should use one of:

- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** - Recommended
- **Git Bash** - Included with Git for Windows

The plugin's shell scripts (`.sh` files) use bash and won't work directly in PowerShell or CMD.

**Troubleshooting Windows:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "bash not found" | Install Git Bash or WSL |
| Hook scripts fail | Run Claude Code from WSL/Git Bash terminal |
| Path errors | Use forward slashes in paths, not backslashes |
| Line ending issues | Configure git: `git config --global core.autocrlf input` |

## Quick Start

### Greenfield Project

Full planning-to-implementation workflow:

```
/design-product           # Define requirements (PRD with EARS format)
/design-architecture      # Design technical approach and decisions
/ux-design                # Establish design system (for UI projects)
/create-tasks             # Generate implementation tasks
/work-on-next-task        # Start executing tasks with TDD
```

### Quick Feature

Skip formal planning and go straight to building:

```
/build-unplanned Add user avatar upload with image resizing
```

### Existing Codebase

Analyze existing code to generate initial specifications:

```
/design-product           # Analyzes codebase to propose PRD
```

## Commands

Commands are what you type to interact with Groundwork. In Claude, commands are prefixed with `groundwork:` (e.g., `/groundwork:design-product`), though the prefix can be omitted if no other plugin uses the same command name. Copilot plugin command wrappers are generated in `copilot/commands/`.

### Planning Commands

Define what to build and how to build it.

| Command | Args | Description | When to Use |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `/design-product` | `[product-name]` | Create or update PRD with EARS requirements | Starting a new project or adding features |
| `/design-architecture` | `[feature-name]` | Design technical architecture with decision records | After PRD exists, need technical design |
| `/ux-design` | `[product-name]` | Establish design system — foundations, brand, UX patterns | Need visual/UX consistency for UI projects |
| `/create-tasks` | `[filter]` | Generate implementation tasks from PRD + architecture | After specs exist, ready to plan implementation |

### Implementation Commands

Execute tasks and build features.

| Command | Args | Description | When to Use |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `/work-on` | `[task-number]` | Execute a specific task with worktree isolation and TDD | Want to work on a specific task by number |
| `/work-on-next-task` | — | Execute the next unblocked task automatically | Working through tasks sequentially |
| `/just-do-it` | — | Execute all remaining tasks in dependency order | Want batch execution of all remaining work |
| `/build-unplanned` | `[description]` | Build feature from description — no task definitions needed | Quick feature without formal planning |

### Debugging Commands

Investigate and resolve issues systematically.

| Command | Args | Description | When to Use |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|

| `/groundwork-help` | — | Show all commands and skills | Quick reference |

## Workflows

### Greenfield Project

Full planning through implementation with continuous synchronization:

```
/design-product              # 1. Define requirements
/design-architecture         # 2. Design technical approach
/ux-design                   # 3. Establish design system (UI projects)
/create-tasks                # 4. Generate task list
/work-on-next-task           # 5. Execute tasks one by one (repeat)
/source-product-specs-from-code   # 6. Sync specs if implementation diverged
/source-architecture-from-code    # 7. Sync architecture if decisions changed
```

### Adding Features to an Existing Project

Incrementally update specs, implement, then sync:

```
/design-product              # Update PRD with new feature requirements
/design-architecture         # Update architecture for new components
/create-tasks                # Generate tasks for the new feature
/work-on-next-task           # Execute tasks
/source-product-specs-from-code   # Sync any implementation-time decisions
```

### Quick Unplanned Feature

Skip planning entirely — go straight to TDD:

```
/build-unplanned Add password strength indicator to signup form
```

This gathers requirements inline, implements with TDD in a worktree, runs verification agents, and merges back.

### Debugging

Systematic 5-phase investigation:

```
/debug Login fails silently when session cookie is expired
```

Phases: Observe → Hypothesize → Predict → Test → Conclude. No fix is applied until the root cause is confirmed.

### Verification

Check quality and alignment at any point:

```
/validate                    # Run all 8 verification agents
/check-specs-alignment       # Audit drift between code and specs
```

## Skills

Skills are internal workflow definitions invoked automatically by the model when you run commands. You don't need to call skills directly (they are, in fact, hidden) — commands handle this for you.

## Internals

For contributors and curious users — how the plugin works under the hood.

### Agents

Agents are specialized sub-processes that run verification and validation tasks. They are invoked automatically by skills like `validation-loop` and `task-validation-loop`.

#### Implementation Verification (8 agents)

These run after task implementation via the `validation-loop` skill:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `code-quality-reviewer` | Reviews code for quality, readability, elegance, and test coverage |
| `security-reviewer` | Reviews for security vulnerabilities — OWASP Top 10, input validation, auth issues |
| `spec-alignment-checker` | Verifies implementation aligns with task definition and product specs |
| `architecture-alignment-checker` | Verifies implementation aligns with architecture decisions and technology choices |
| `code-simplifier` | Simplifies code for clarity and maintainability while preserving functionality |
| `housekeeper` | Verifies housekeeping — task status updates, action items, documentation changes |
| `performance-reviewer` | Reviews for performance issues — algorithmic complexity, memory, I/O |
| `design-consistency-checker` | Verifies design system compliance — tokens, accessibility, pattern consistency |

#### Task Validation (3 agents)

These run after task list creation via the `task-validation-loop` skill:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `prd-task-alignment-checker` | Validates task list covers all PRD requirements |
| `architecture-task-alignment-checker` | Validates tasks follow architecture decisions and patterns |
| `design-task-alignment-checker` | Validates UI/frontend tasks include design tokens and accessibility |

#### Architecture Validation (1 agent)

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `prd-architecture-checker` | Validates architecture proposals cover all PRD requirements and NFRs |

#### Research (1 agent)

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `researcher` | Researches technologies and patterns before architecture decisions or task planning |

### Hooks

Hooks are event-driven automations that fire at specific points in the Claude Code and Copilot CLI lifecycles:

| Hook | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Session Start | `SessionStart` / `sessionStart` | Detects project state, loads skill context, checks for updates (1x/day) |
| Session End/Pre-Compact | `PreCompact` / `sessionEnd` | Preserves critical skill state before context compaction/session close |
| Commit Alignment | `PostToolUse` / `postToolUse` (on `git commit`) | Verifies commits align with specs and task definitions |
| Agent Output | `SubagentStop` / `postToolUse` (delegate/task tools) | Validates agent output format |

## Configuration

### Update Checking

The plugin checks for updates once per day (throttled) and shows a notification if updates are available. Update by running:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/groundwork && git pull
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GROUNDWORK_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK` | 0 | Set to 1 to skip update checking |

See `docs/hooks-configuration.md` for full documentation.
