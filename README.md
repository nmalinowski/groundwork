# Groundwork

A comprehensive skills library for Claude Code, consolidating proven techniques for planning, design, TDD, debugging, collaboration, and problem-solving.

## Installation

### Via Marketplace

First, add the Groundwork marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/etr/groundwork-marketplace
```

Then install the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin install groundwork
```

#### Update via Marketplace

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update groundwork-marketplace

claude plugin update groundwork
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins
git clone https://github.com/etr/groundwork.git
```

Or use the installer provided with the codebase.

### Other Platforms (Experimental)

> **Warning:** Installation on platforms other than Claude Code is experimental. Skills and agents are automatically transformed to work without Claude Code's plugin system, but some features (hooks, slash commands, skill chaining) may not work identically. Use at your own risk.

Groundwork skills and agents can be installed into other AI coding tools using the included installer script. The installer transforms skill content to remove Claude Code-specific constructs and adapts the format for each target.

#### Supported Targets

| Target | Flag | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | `--codex` | Agents are installed as skills with a `review-` prefix |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) | `--opencode` | Agents are installed as standalone agent files |
| [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) | `--kiro` | Agents use JSON config + prompt file pairs |

#### Installation

Clone the repository and run the installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etr/groundwork.git
cd groundwork
```

Install globally (available in all projects):

```bash
./install-skills.sh --codex --global
```

Install for the current project only:

```bash
./install-skills.sh --opencode --project
```

You can install to multiple targets at once:

```bash
./install-skills.sh --codex --opencode --kiro --global
```

#### Installer Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--global` | Install to user-level config directory |
| `--project` | Install to current project directory |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing files |
| `--dry-run` | Preview actions without making changes |
| `--skills-only` | Install only skills (skip agents) |
| `--source DIR` | Groundwork source directory (default: auto-detect) |

#### What Gets Installed

- **Skills** — Workflow definitions (planning, TDD, debugging, etc.) are installed with a `groundwork-` prefix. On OpenCode, skill dependencies are automatically inlined as appendix sections.
- **Agents** — Verification and review agents (code quality, security, architecture alignment, etc.) are installed in each target's native agent format.
- **Hooks** — Not installed automatically. Event-driven automations (session start, pre-compact, commit alignment) require manual setup for each tool.
- **Commands** — Not applicable. Other tools discover skills directly by name rather than through slash commands.

#### Limitations

- Hooks (`SessionStart`, `PreCompact`, `PostToolUse`) are not portable and must be configured manually for each tool
- On OpenCode, complex multi-skill workflows may lose interactivity since skill dependencies are inlined as static appendix sections rather than invoked at runtime
- Update checking is not available outside Claude Code

### Verify Installation

Restart Claude Code or start a new session. You should see:
- Start typing `/groundwork`. It should show groundwork commands available

Run `/groundwork-check` to validate the plugin installation.

## Dependencies

- **Required**: `node`, `python3`
- **Optional**: `gh` (GitHub CLI for PR commands)

### Windows Users

Groundwork requires a Unix-like shell environment. Windows users should use one of:

- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** - Recommended
- **Git Bash** - Included with Git for Windows

The plugin's shell scripts (`.sh` files) use bash and won't work directly in PowerShell or CMD.

**Troubleshooting Windows:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "bash not found" | Install Git Bash or WSL |
| Hook scripts fail | Run Claude Code from WSL/Git Bash terminal |
| Path errors | Use forward slashes in paths, not backslashes |
| Line ending issues | Configure git: `git config --global core.autocrlf input` |

## Quick Start

### Greenfield Project

Full planning-to-implementation workflow:

```
/design-product           # Define requirements (PRD with EARS format)
/design-architecture      # Design technical approach and decisions
/ux-design                # Establish design system (for UI projects)
/create-tasks             # Generate implementation tasks
/work-on-next-task        # Start executing tasks with TDD
```

### Quick Feature

Skip formal planning and go straight to building:

```
/build-unplanned Add user avatar upload with image resizing
```

### Existing Codebase

Analyze existing code to generate initial specifications:

```
/design-product           # Analyzes codebase to propose PRD
```

## Commands

Commands are what you type to interact with Groundwork. All commands are prefixed with `groundwork:` (e.g., `/groundwork:design-product`), though the prefix can be omitted if no other plugin uses the same command name.

### Planning Commands

Define what to build and how to build it.

| Command | Args | Description | When to Use |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `/design-product` | `[product-name]` | Create or update PRD with EARS requirements | Starting a new project or adding features |
| `/design-architecture` | `[feature-name]` | Design technical architecture with decision records | After PRD exists, need technical design |
| `/ux-design` | `[product-name]` | Establish design system — foundations, brand, UX patterns | Need visual/UX consistency for UI projects |
| `/create-tasks` | `[filter]` | Generate implementation tasks from PRD + architecture | After specs exist, ready to plan implementation |

### Implementation Commands

Execute tasks and build features.

| Command | Args | Description | When to Use |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `/work-on` | `[task-number]` | Execute a specific task with worktree isolation and TDD | Want to work on a specific task by number |
| `/work-on-next-task` | — | Execute the next unblocked task automatically | Working through tasks sequentially |
| `/just-do-it` | — | Execute all remaining tasks in dependency order | Want batch execution of all remaining work |
| `/build-unplanned` | `[description]` | Build feature from description — no task definitions needed | Quick feature without formal planning |

### Debugging Commands

Investigate and resolve issues systematically.

| Command | Args | Description | When to Use |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `/debug` | `[bug description]` | Systematic 5-phase debugging workflow | Investigating bugs or test failures |

| `/check-specs-alignment` | `[context]` | Audit code alignment with PRD and architecture | Periodic drift detection |

### Synchronization Commands

Keep specs in sync with what was actually built. Run these at the end of a session when implementation diverged from the original plan.

| Command | Args | Description | When to Use |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `/source-product-specs-from-code` | `[files...]` | Update PRD to reflect implementation changes | After product decisions during implementation |
| `/source-architecture-from-code` | `[files...]` | Update architecture docs with new decisions | After architectural changes during implementation |
| `/source-ux-design-from-code` | `[files...]` | Update design system with token/pattern changes | After design changes during implementation |

### Utility Commands

Plugin management and reference.

| Command | Args | Description | When to Use |
|---------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `/split-spec` | `[spec-type]` | Convert single-file spec to directory structure | Specs getting too large for one file |
| `/skills` | — | List all available Groundwork skills | Discovering available capabilities |
| `/groundwork-check` | — | Validate plugin installation | Troubleshooting issues |
| `/groundwork-help` | — | Show all commands and skills | Quick reference |

## Workflows

### Greenfield Project

Full planning through implementation with continuous synchronization:

```
/design-product              # 1. Define requirements
/design-architecture         # 2. Design technical approach
/ux-design                   # 3. Establish design system (UI projects)
/create-tasks                # 4. Generate task list
/work-on-next-task           # 5. Execute tasks one by one (repeat)
/source-product-specs-from-code   # 6. Sync specs if implementation diverged
/source-architecture-from-code    # 7. Sync architecture if decisions changed
```

### Adding Features to an Existing Project

Incrementally update specs, implement, then sync:

```
/design-product              # Update PRD with new feature requirements
/design-architecture         # Update architecture for new components
/create-tasks                # Generate tasks for the new feature
/work-on-next-task           # Execute tasks
/source-product-specs-from-code   # Sync any implementation-time decisions
```

### Quick Unplanned Feature

Skip planning entirely — go straight to TDD:

```
/build-unplanned Add password strength indicator to signup form
```

This gathers requirements inline, implements with TDD in a worktree, runs verification agents, and merges back.

### Debugging

Systematic 5-phase investigation:

```
/debug Login fails silently when session cookie is expired
```

Phases: Observe → Hypothesize → Predict → Test → Conclude. No fix is applied until the root cause is confirmed.

### Verification

Check quality and alignment at any point:

```
/validate                    # Run all 8 verification agents
/check-specs-alignment       # Audit drift between code and specs
```

## Skills

Skills are internal workflow definitions invoked automatically by the model when you run commands. You don't need to call skills directly (they are, in fact, hidden) — commands handle this for you.

| `performance-reviewer` | Reviews for performance issues — algorithmic complexity, memory, I/O |
| `design-consistency-checker` | Verifies design system compliance — tokens, accessibility, pattern consistency |

#### Task Validation (3 agents)

These run after task list creation via the `task-validation-loop` skill:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `prd-task-alignment-checker` | Validates task list covers all PRD requirements |

### Hooks

Hooks are event-driven automations that fire at specific points in the Claude Code lifecycle:

| Hook | Event | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Session Start | `SessionStart` | Detects project state, loads skill context, checks for updates (1x/day) |
| Pre-Compact | `PreCompact` | Preserves critical skill state before context compaction |
| Commit Alignment | `PostToolUse` (on `git commit`) | Verifies commits align with specs and task definitions |
| Agent Output | `SubagentStop` | Validates agent output format |

## Configuration

### Update Checking

The plugin checks for updates once per day (throttled) and shows a notification if updates are available. Update by running:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/groundwork && git pull
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `GROUNDWORK_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK` | 0 | Set to 1 to skip update checking |

See `docs/hooks-configuration.md` for full documentation.
