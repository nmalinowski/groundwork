## Copilot Compatibility Notes

- `Skill(skill="groundwork:<name>")` should be interpreted as using the corresponding `/<name>` skill.
- `Task(...)` references should be handled with Copilot custom agents (`/agent`) or delegated workflows.
- `AskUserQuestion` references should be handled by asking the user directly and waiting for input.
- `Plan`/`ExitPlanMode` references map to Copilot plan mode toggling.

# Design System Skill

Establishes a complete design system through guided collaboration: foundations, brand identity, and UX patterns.

## Collaboration Approach

- **Lead with recommendations** - "I recommend X because [your context]"
- **Minimize questions** - Most context is in PRD/architecture
- **Iterate on feedback** - Adjust specific elements, don't restart
- **Accept user direction** - If user has specific preferences, incorporate them
- **Use AskUserQuestion tool** - When asking the user questions, always use the AskUserQuestion tool with appropriate options

When user doesn't have a preference:
> "I'll go with [X] because [reason]. I can adjust later if needed."

Document and move on.

## File Locations

- **Input:**
  - `specs/product_specs.md` (PRD with personas, vision, NFRs)
  - `specs/architecture.md` (technical constraints, API patterns)
- **Output:** `specs/design_system.md`

## Prerequisites

Check for PRD first. If `specs/product_specs.md` doesn't exist, prompt user to run `/product-design` first.

Architecture file is optional but helpful for UX pattern decisions.


## Phase 1: Foundations

### Step 1: Context Gathering

Extract design-relevant context from PRD + a few targeted questions.

**From PRD (already available):**
- Personas -> accessibility needs, expertise level
- Product vision -> personality keywords
- NFRs -> any explicit accessibility requirements

**Targeted Questions (only what's missing):**

> "Before we define the design system, a few quick questions:
> 1. Do you have existing brand colors/fonts, or starting fresh?
> 2. Any specific accessibility requirements? (WCAG level, legal compliance)
> 3. Is this mobile-first, desktop-first, or balanced?"

Move on quickly after gathering constraints.

### Step 2: Propose Design Principles

Based on context, propose principles and explain why.

> "Based on [specific context from PRD], I recommend these guiding principles:
>
> **DP-001: Clarity First**
> Your [persona] users need to make quick decisions - clarity beats cleverness.
>
> **DP-002: [Principle Name]**
> Because [specific reason tied to their context].
>
> **DP-003: [Principle Name]**
> This supports [their stated goal/constraint].
>
> Does this direction feel right? I can adjust if something's off."

**Handle Feedback:**
- User agrees -> Document and proceed to Phase 2
- User pushes back -> Adjust specific principle, don't restart

### Step 3: Establish Tokens

Define foundational token categories without waiting for approval on each:

**Spacing Scale (4px base):**
- `--space-1`: 4px through `--space-16`: 64px

**Elevation Scale:**
- `--elevation-0` (flat) through `--elevation-3` (modals)

**Border Radius:**
- `--radius-none` (0) through `--radius-full` (pills)

Present as a cohesive system. Only adjust if user has concerns.


## Phase 2: Brand Identity

### Step 4: Color Recommendation

Propose based on context (not menu options).

> "For a [product type] targeting [persona], I recommend:
>
> **Primary: Deep Blue (#1E40AF)**
> Conveys trust and professionalism. Meets WCAG AA contrast.
>
> **Secondary: Warm Gray (#78716C)**
> Softens the blue, adds approachability without being casual.
>
> **Accent: Amber (#F59E0B)**
> For CTAs and highlights - draws attention without competing.
>
> This palette aligns with [DP-001: Clarity First].
> Does this direction work, or should I adjust toward [warmer/cooler/bolder]?"

**Handle Feedback:**
- "I want it more [X]" -> Adjust and show revised
- "I have specific colors" -> Incorporate them, ensure contrast/harmony
- "Looks good" -> Document as BRD-001/002/003

**Semantic Colors (standard, propose without asking):**

| Semantic | Color | Usage |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Success | Green #22C55E | Confirmations, completed states |
| Warning | Amber #F59E0B | Cautions, pending actions |
| Error | Red #EF4444 | Errors, destructive actions |
| Info | Blue #3B82F6 | Informational messages |

**Neutral Palette:**
Define gray scale for text, backgrounds, borders. Propose based on primary color temperature.

### Step 5: Typography Recommendation

> "For [product personality], I recommend:
>
> **Font: Inter** - Modern, highly readable, professional but not stuffy.
> **Scale: 16px base** - Clear hierarchy without overwhelming.
>
> | Token | Size | Usage |
> |-------|------|-------|
> | `--text-xs` | 12px | Captions, labels |
> | `--text-sm` | 14px | Secondary text |
> | `--text-base` | 16px | Body text |
> | `--text-lg` | 18px | Lead paragraphs |
> | `--text-xl` | 20px | Section headers |
> | `--text-2xl` | 24px | Page headers |
> | `--text-3xl` | 30px | Hero text |
>
> Want something more [distinctive/formal/playful] instead?"

Only dig deeper if user has concerns.

### Step 6: Brand Voice

> "For UI copy, I recommend this voice:
>
> **Tone:** [Professional but approachable] - matches [persona] expectations
> **Style:** [Concise, action-oriented] - supports [DP-001: Clarity First]
>
> Example error: 'We couldn't save your changes. Try again?'
> Example empty state: 'No projects yet. Create your first one.'
> Example success: 'Changes saved'
>
> Does this tone feel right?"


## Phase 3: UX Patterns

### Step 7: Recommend Patterns as a System

Derive from architecture + PRD (minimal questions needed).

> "Based on your architecture and product needs, here's the UX pattern system:
>
> **Navigation: Sidebar with collapsible sections**
> You have [N] top-level features. Sidebar keeps everything accessible.
>
> **Loading: Skeleton screens + optimistic updates**
> Your API is fast. Skeletons for initial loads, optimistic for writes.
>
> **Errors: Layered approach**
> - Inline for field validation
> - Toast for operation failures
> - Banner for system issues
>
> **Empty States: Illustrated with clear CTA**
> First-run guides users; no-data encourages action.
>
> **Forms: Validate on blur**
> Catches issues early without being intrusive.
>
> **Responsive: Mobile-first breakpoints**
> Standard Tailwind scale (sm/md/lg/xl).
>
> **Motion: Purposeful and quick**
> - Micro-interactions: 100-200ms
> - Transitions: 200-300ms
> - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
>
> This is a cohesive system. Any patterns you want me to reconsider?"

**Handle Feedback:**
- User agrees -> Document all as UXD-001 through UXD-00N
- User questions one -> Explain reasoning, adjust if needed


## Step 8: Document Design System

Create `specs/design_system.md` using template in `references/design-system-template.md`.

Populate all sections:
1. **Foundations** - DP-NNN principles, accessibility level, tokens
2. **Brand Identity** - Colors, typography, voice
3. **UX Patterns** - Navigation, loading, errors, forms, responsive, motion
4. **Decision Log** - All decisions with context and rationale

Present summary for review, then write the file.

> "Here's the complete design system:
>
> **Foundations:** [N] design principles, WCAG [level], token system
> **Brand:** [Primary color], [Font], [Voice tone]
> **UX Patterns:** [Nav type], [Loading strategy], [Error approach]
>
> Ready to document this in `specs/design_system.md`?"

## Step 9: Suggest Next Step

After successfully updating the architecture document, ask what should be the next workflow step:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What would you like to do next?",
    "header": "Next step",
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "Design architecture",
        "description": "Translate these requirements into technical architecture decisions"
      },
      {
        "label": "Create tasks",
        "description": "Break product/architecture/UX down into tasks"
      }
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

**Handle the response:**

- **Design architecture**: Invoke the `groundwork:architecture` skill to design the technical approach
- **Create tasks**: Invoke the `groundwork:tasks` skill to create a list of executable tasks


## Decision Record Format

Each decision follows a lightweight format:

```markdown
### [PREFIX]-NNN: [Decision Title]

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Context:** [Why this matters for this product]

**Decision:** [What was decided]

**Rationale:** [Why, referencing context or other decisions]
```

**Prefixes:**
- `DP-NNN` - Design Principles
- `BRD-NNN` - Brand Identity decisions
- `UXD-NNN` - UX Pattern decisions
