## Copilot Compatibility Notes

- `Skill(skill="groundwork:<name>")` should be interpreted as using the corresponding `/<name>` skill.
- `Task(...)` references should be handled with Copilot custom agents (`/agent`) or delegated workflows.
- `AskUserQuestion` references should be handled by asking the user directly and waiting for input.
- `Plan`/`ExitPlanMode` references map to Copilot plan mode toggling.

# Task Validation Loop Skill

Autonomous verification loop that runs 3 specialized agents to validate task list completeness and alignment before implementation begins.

## Prerequisites

Before invoking this skill, ensure:
- Task list is complete (specs/tasks.md exists)
- PRD exists (specs/product_specs.md)
- Architecture exists (specs/architecture.md)
- User has approved the task breakdown

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Context

Collect inputs for the agents:

```
task_list     ← Read specs/tasks.md (or specs/tasks/ directory)
product_specs ← Read specs/product_specs.md (or specs/product_specs/ directory)
architecture  ← Read specs/architecture.md (or specs/architecture/ directory)
design_system ← Read specs/design_system.md (if exists, optional)
```

**Detection:** Check for file first (takes precedence), then directory. When reading a directory, aggregate all `.md` files recursively.

### 2. Launch Validation Agents

Use Task tool to launch all 3 agents in parallel:

| Agent (`subagent_type`) | Context to Provide |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| `groundwork:prd-task-alignment-checker:prd-task-alignment-checker` | task_list, product_specs |
| `groundwork:architecture-task-alignment-checker:architecture-task-alignment-checker` | task_list, architecture |
| `groundwork:design-task-alignment-checker:design-task-alignment-checker` | task_list, design_system |

Each returns JSON:
```json
{
  "summary": "One-sentence assessment",
  "score": 0-100,
  "findings": [{"severity": "critical|major|minor", "category": "...", "task_reference": "TASK-NNN", "finding": "...", "recommendation": "..."}],
  "verdict": "approve|request-changes"
}
```

### 3. Aggregate Results

Present results in table format:

```markdown
## Task List Validation Report

| Agent | Score | Verdict | Critical | Major | Minor |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| PRD Alignment | 92 | approve | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| Architecture Alignment | 88 | approve | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| Design Alignment | 85 | approve | 0 | 2 | 1 |

**Overall:** PASS / NEEDS FIXES
```

### 4. Autonomous Fix-and-Retry Loop

**Rule**: Continue this loop until ALL agents return `approve`.

**On any `request-changes` verdict:**

1. **Log Iteration**
   ```markdown
   ## Validation Iteration [N]
   | Agent | Verdict | Findings |
   |-------|---------|----------|
   | ... | ... | ... |
   Fixing [X] issues...
   ```

2. **Fix Each Finding** - Apply each critical/major recommendation
   - Modify specs/tasks.md with required changes
   - Track what was changed
   - Note which finding each fix addresses

   Fix types:
   - **requirement-not-tasked**: Add new task for the requirement
   - **component-mismatch**: Update task's Component field
   - **accessibility-missing**: Add acceptance criteria to task
   - **over-tasked**: Remove task or add requirement to PRD (user decision)

3. **Re-run Agent Validation** - Launch all 3 agents again with updated task list

4. **Check Results**
   - ALL approve → **PASS**, return success
   - Any request-changes → Return to step 1

### 5. Stuck Detection

Track findings by key: `[Agent]-[Category]-[TaskRef]`

If same finding appears **3 times**:

```markdown
## Stuck - Need User Input

Issue persists after 3 attempts:

**[Agent] Finding description**
- Task: TASK-NNN
- Category: [category]
- Attempts:
  1. [what was tried]
  2. [what was tried]
  3. [what was tried]

I need clarification: [specific question]
```

- Use AskUserQuestion for guidance
- Apply fix based on user input
- Continue loop

Also escalate when:
- Conflicting requirements between PRD and architecture
- Missing information to create required task
- Scope decisions needed (add to PRD vs. remove task)

### 6. Return Result

**On PASS:**
```markdown
## Task List Validation PASSED

All 3 agents approved after [N] iteration(s).

| Agent | Score | Verdict | Summary |
|-------|-------|---------|---------|
| PRD Alignment | 95 | APPROVE | All requirements covered |
| Architecture Alignment | 92 | APPROVE | Tasks follow architecture |
| Design Alignment | 90 | APPROVE | UI tasks include a11y |

Issues fixed:
- [Iteration N] Agent: Description

Coverage Summary:
- PRD Requirements: [X]% covered
- Architecture Components: All referenced
- Design System: [Applied/N/A]

Minor suggestions (optional):
- ...
```

Return control to calling skill (tasks skill).

## Severity Reference

| Level | Action |
|-------|--------|
| critical | Must fix, loop continues |
| major | Must fix, loop continues |
| minor | Optional, does not block |

## Edge Cases

**No design system:**
- Design agent still runs (checks accessibility)
- Note in summary: "Design system not found"

**Agent returns error:**
- Log the error
- Retry once
- If still fails, escalate to user

**All agents approve immediately:**
- Log success
- Return without iteration
